# Overview

## Description
This program comes up with a random number that the user has to guess. the program tells the user if the number is to high or low or it is just right. It makes sure that user puts a valid guess or it keeps asking for a valid answer.

## Purpose 
I wrote this program to help understand java better, I intentionally chose a program that would take user input because I have heard that it was hard to do.

# Development Environment

## Tools
I used Java gradle to help me with the file structure and to run the program in VS code which is another tool that I used

## Libraries 
I used java.until.Random which picked a random number for the user to guess. I also used java.util.scanner which helped be get user input and use it in my program.

# Future Work

- I want to put a prompt that the user makes the range for the guessing game and not have it hard coded
- I want to make a ui for this project
